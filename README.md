- Data is retrieved from a json file so that it can be replaced, as long as the json data follows the same object pattern, and has the same name and location.
- Data is displayed in two different ways : a datatable and a specific datatable.
- The first table contains all the data which can be filtered by a date time period.
- The second table contains the average, minimum and maximum value for each parameter. 
- Each table provides the ability to hide/show columns, sort by column, specify the number of rows by page, and use a pagination system.
